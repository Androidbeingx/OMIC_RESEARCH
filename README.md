# Selected species:
- Felis catus (domestic cat)

# Selected related species (write here any of your suggestions):
1. Panthera pardus (leopard) / Acinonyx jubatus (cheetah)
2. Panthera tigris (tiger)
3. Puma concolor (puma)
4. Vulpes vulpes (red fox) *
5. Pan paniscus (pygmy chimpanzee) * more related to humans 

* Tottally different species interesting to see the relation
Andrea: Would be interesting to see all diferent families leopard -> cheetah, 5 + cat would be 6 species like 2 each one.

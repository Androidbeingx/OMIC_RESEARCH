# Organism A: Fruit Flies

## Species of Organism A:

- Drosophila melanogaster
- Drosophila simulans
- Drosophila sechellia
- Drosophila yakuba
- Drosophila erecta
- Drosophila ananassae

## Gene: Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene

Hypothesis: The Adh gene in different species of fruit flies will have variations in their gene sequence, but the overall function of the gene will remain the same, i.e. the gene will be responsible for breaking down alcohol, and thus will have a conserved domain.

Mutations in the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene can lead to changes in the activity and stability of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. This can result in alcohol intolerance and an increased risk of alcoholism in some individuals.

It is important to note that while the Adh gene is present in fruit flies, it is also present in humans and other organisms. In humans, mutations in the Adh gene have been associated with a number of health problems, including alcohol intolerance, flushing (redness and warmth of the skin after drinking alcohol), and an increased risk of alcoholism. However, these conditions are relatively rare and are typically caused by specific genetic variants in the Adh gene.

The specific variants of the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene that have been associated with alcohol intolerance in humans include ADH1B47H and ADH1B2. These variants result in a reduced activity of the ADH enzyme, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxic intermediate product of alcohol metabolism, in the body. This accumulation causes the symptoms of alcohol intolerance, such as flushing (redness and warmth of the skin after drinking alcohol), rapid heartbeat, nausea, and headache.

It's important to note that not everyone who carries these variants will develop alcohol intolerance. Other factors, such as overall health, diet, and the presence of other genes that affect alcohol metabolism, can also play a role.

The human ADH1B gene is orthologous to the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene in Drosophila melanogaster. Orthologs are genes in different species that are derived from a common ancestral gene and have evolved to perform similar functions in those species. In this case, the human ADH1B gene and the Adh gene in Drosophila melanogaster both encode enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of alcohol.

It's worth noting that while the function of the human ADH1B and Drosophila melanogaster Adh genes are similar, the specific mutations and regulatory regions of these genes can differ between the two species, leading to differences in the expression and activity of these genes.

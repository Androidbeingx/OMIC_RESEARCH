# Hypothesis 2

### HPGD is an Adh gene orthologue.

Following the above hypothesis, we found that the fruit fly adh gene has an orthologue in humans, the HPGD gene. This gene, despite sharing similarities in composition, has a different function, which is related to inflammation of the fingers and nails. 

In this hypothesis we want to find out to what extent they are the same and the alignment between them, and their respective functions.

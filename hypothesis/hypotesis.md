Hypothesis 1
==============

### Chosen organisms:
- Organism A: Fruit Flies
- Organism B: Homo Sapiens


### Species of Organism A:
- Drosophila melanogaster
- Drosophila simulans
- Drosophila sechellia
- Drosophila yakuba
- Drosophila erecta
- Drosophila ananassae
- Drosophila suzukii
- Drosophila teissieri


### Chosen genes:
- Adh (Alcohol dehydrogenase)
- ADH1B (Alcohol dehydrogenase, prefered name: "All-trans-retinol dehydrogenase")


#### Motives
Comparing the Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene of the Drosophila family with
the Homo sapien's ADH1B gene, which is associated with alcohol intolerance,
seems an interesting combination and further investigation of it can provide a
unique opportunity to gain insights into the evolutionary history of
alcohol metabolism and the genetic basis of alcohol-related traits in diverse
organisms.


#### Hypothesis
In humans, mutations in the *Alcohol dehydrogenase* (ADH1B) gene have been
associated with a number of health problems, including alcohol intolerance,
flushing (redness and warmth of the skin after drinking alcohol) and an
increased risk of alcoholism. However, these conditions are relatively rare and
are usually caused by specific genetic variants of the Adh gene.

The Adh gene is present in fruit flies and other organisms. We are interested
in finding out how this gene varies in fruit flies, what variations and
similarities there are, in order to carry out an experimental study and thus be
able to treat diseases caused by mutations in this gene.

The human ADH1B gene is an orthologue of the Drosophila melanogaster alcohol
dehydrogenase (Adh) gene.
They derive from a common ancestral gene and have evolved to perform similar
functions in those species. In this case, the human ADH1B gene and the
Drosophila melanogaster Adh gene encode enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism.

It should be noted that although the function of the human ADH1B and Drosophila
melanogaster Adh genes is similar, the specific mutations and regulatory
regions of these genes may differ between the two species, resulting in
differences in the expression and activity of these genes. This is exactly what
we would like to exploit with our project.


#### About Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene
The Adh gene in different species of fruit flies will have variations in its
genetic sequence, but the overall function of the gene will remain the same,
i.e. the gene will be responsible for breaking down alcohol and will therefore
have a conserved domain.

Mutations in the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene can lead to changes in the
activity and stability of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. This can lead to
alcohol intolerance and an increased risk of alcoholism in some individuals.

Specific variants in the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene have been
associated with alcohol intolerance in humans, such as ADH1B
alcohol dehydrogenase (prefered name is "all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase").

This variant result in reduced activity of the Adh enzyme, leading to a
build-up of acetaldehyde, a toxic intermediate product of alcohol metabolism,
in the body. This build-up causes the symptoms of alcohol intolerance, such as
flushing (redness and warmth of the skin after drinking alcohol), tachycardia,
nausea and headache.

(NOTE: It is important to note that not all people carrying these variants will
develop alcohol intolerance. Other factors such as general health, diet and the
presence of other genes that affect alcohol metabolism may also play a role.)


#### Conclusion
The results of the alignment of the Alcohol dehydrogenase gene from different
Drosophila species against the ADH1B gene from Homo sapiens show that the
identity percentage ranges from 34.55% to 38.75%, with the highest identity
found in Drosophila simulans and the lowest in Drosophila ananassae.

This indicates that the Alcohol dehydrogenase gene has evolved differently in each
of these species. The gene product, chromosome, and gene locus are conserved across the
Drosophila species studied, except for Drosophila persimilis, Drosophila
guanche and Drosophila erecta, where the chromosome and gene locus are unknown.

The alignment score results suggest that alcohol intolerance sickness could be caused by
differences in the activity or expression of the ADH1B gene in humans, rather
than by differences in the Alcohol dehydrogenase gene in Drosophila.

However, more research is needed to determine whether the differences in the Alcohol
dehydrogenase gene affect alcohol metabolism in Drosophila and if these
differences could be used to develop treatments for alcohol intolerance
sickness.

Overall, the results of this study provide important insights into
the evolution and function of Alcohol dehydrogenase gene in different
Drosophila species, and may have implications for understanding the genetic
basis of alcohol metabolism in humans.

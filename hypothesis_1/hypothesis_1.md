#### Hypothesis

In humans, mutations in the Adh gene have been associated with a number of health problems, including alcohol intolerance, flushing (redness and warmth of the skin after drinking alcohol) and an increased risk of alcoholism. However, these conditions are relatively rare and are usually caused by specific genetic variants of the Adh gene.

The Adh gene is present in fruit flies and other organisms.
We are interested in finding out how this gene behaves in fruit flies, what variations there are and what similarities there are, in order to carry out an experimental study and thus be able to treat diseases caused by mutations in this gene.


#### Gene: Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene

The Adh gene in different species of fruit flies will have variations in its genetic sequence, but the overall function of the gene will remain the same, i.e. the gene will be responsible for breaking down alcohol and will therefore have a conserved domain.

Mutations in the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene can lead to changes in the activity and stability of the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme. This can lead to alcohol intolerance and an increased risk of alcoholism in some individuals.

Specific variants in the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene that have been associated with alcohol intolerance in humans include ADH1B47His and ADH1B2. These variants result in reduced activity of the ADH enzyme, leading to a build-up of acetaldehyde, a toxic intermediate product of alcohol metabolism, in the body. This build-up causes the symptoms of alcohol intolerance, such as flushing (redness and warmth of the skin after drinking alcohol), tachycardia, nausea and headache.

It is important to note that not all people carrying these variants will develop alcohol intolerance. Other factors such as general health, diet and the presence of other genes that affect alcohol metabolism may also play a role.

The human ADH1B gene is an orthologue of the Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene. Orthologues are genes from different species that derive from a common ancestral gene and have evolved to perform similar functions in those species. In this case, the human ADH1B gene and the Drosophila melanogaster Adh gene encode enzymes involved in alcohol metabolism.

It should be noted that although the function of the human ADH1B and Drosophila melanogaster Adh genes is similar, the specific mutations and regulatory regions of these genes may differ between the two species, resulting in differences in the expression and activity of these genes.
